The project is likely an application (perhaps a local LLM interface, an automated agent, or a custom chatbot) where maintaining the conversation history and learning from past interactions is critical for coherence.\n2.  **Stateful Agent\/Automation:** It could be an automation tool or an agent that needs to \"remember\" previous actions, configuration states, or observations made during long-running processes.\n3.  **Knowledge Graph\/Entity Tracking System:** If the relevance scoring is complex, the system might be building a rudimentary, session-based knowledge graph where it tracks important entities and their relationships over time.\n\n**In essence, `project_nemi` is likely designed to be a system that requires short-term and\/or long-term context awareness to function effectively.**\n\n## Inferred Structure of `project_nemi`\n\nIf `MemoryManager.php` is a core component, the rest of the project structure likely revolves around supporting its functions:\n\n### 1. Core Interaction\/Processing Layer (The \"Brain\")\n\nThere must be components that **use** the memory manager. These components would likely be:\n\n*   **Input Processor:** Handles receiving raw user input (text, commands, data).\n*   **Logic\/Agent Controller:** This is the main engine that decides what to do next. It would call `MemoryManager->retrieveContext(input)` before processing, and then call `MemoryManager->storeInteraction(input, output)` afterward.\n*   **Output Generator:** Responsible for formatting the final response, perhaps leveraging the retrieved context.\n\n### 2. Persistence Layer (Supported by `MemoryManager`)\n\nSince the memory is saved to **JSON files**, this implies a relatively simple, file-based persistence model rather than a relational or NoSQL database.\n\n*   **Data Structure:** There are likely other files or directories dedicated to storing these JSON artifacts (e.g., a `\/data` or `\/memory_dumps` directory).\n*   **Serialization:** Other parts of the system must be responsible for serializing data *into* the format expected by `MemoryManager` before storage.\n\n### 3. Utility and Configuration Layers\n\n*   **Configuration Manager:** To define parameters like JSON file paths, memory limits, and the threshold for the relevance scoring system.\n*   **Relevance Scorer Implementation:** While `MemoryManager` *uses* a scoring system, the actual algorithm for scoring relevance (e.g., cosine similarity, keyword density) might reside in its own dedicated utility class or be embedded within the Manager itself.\n\n### Summary of Dependencies\n\nThe `MemoryManager` acts as a central hub connecting the **Input\/Processing Logic** with the **File System Persistence**, making it a crucial abstraction layer for state management within `project_nemi`.'. \n---END CONTEXT---\n\nNow, answer this new question from the user:\n\"i have school tommorrow\""
